=================

Markup translator is a project which will help at least one guy in the world (me - nAndy). We tried to do [a quick poll on Twitter](https://twitter.com/nandy_andy/status/490834844231139328) but only one person replied and his answer didn't help us much :P But we're gratful he found time to respond to our tweet :)

The project was created in a rush and we'd like it to represent PHP developers from Pozna≈Ñ. We're working on it during an event called [phpackaton](http://phpers.github.io/phpackaton/) (unfortunately the page is in Polish only).
